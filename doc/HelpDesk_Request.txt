I am writing to request the generation of necessary credentials for an automated email scanning script we are developing. 
This script will be used to process incoming emails based on specific criteria and move the processed emails into a sub-folder 
in the same mailbox.

Application name:  mobile devices survey 
Target Mailbox: mobilereponse@cdc,gov
Please help us obtain the required credentials for an Azure AD Application Registration that will allow the script to authenticate to the target mailbox and using the client credentials flow.  
Specifically, we need:
1.	Tenant ID
2.	Client ID (Application ID) 
3.	Client Secret: 
The application requires the following Application permissions (not Delegated):
•	Mail.Read: To read emails from the specified mailbox.
•	Mail.ReadWrite: To move emails to a sub-folder within the specified mailbox. 
Please ensure these permissions are granted and have received admin consent for the application. The script uses https://graph.microsoft.com/.default scope, relying on pre-consented application permissions.
